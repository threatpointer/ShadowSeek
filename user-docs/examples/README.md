### **Code Formatting Standards**
All examples follow consistent formatting guidelines:

#### **Command Line Examples**
```bash
# Long commands are broken into readable lines
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"key": "value"}' \
  "$BASE_URL/api/endpoint"

# Parameters are aligned for clarity
python manage.py create-user \
  --email admin@company.com \
  --role admin \
  --active true
```

#### **Configuration Files**
```yaml
# YAML configurations use proper indentation
database:
  url: postgresql://user:pass@localhost/shadowseek
  pool_size: 20
  max_overflow: 30

ai:
  default_provider: openai
  model: gpt-4
  temperature: 0.1
```

#### **Code Examples**
```python
# Python code includes proper spacing and comments
def analyze_binary(binary_path):
    """
    Analyze binary file for security vulnerabilities
    
    Args:
        binary_path (str): Path to binary file
        
    Returns:
        dict: Analysis results
    """
    
    # Upload binary
    with open(binary_path, "rb") as f:
        binary = client.upload_binary(f)
    
    # Start analysis
    analysis = client.analyze_binary(
        binary.id,
        analysis_types=["static", "ai", "security"]
    )
    
    return analysis
```
