# Tests Directory

The test files that were previously in this directory have been moved to the `archive/testing` directory.

## Running Tests

To run tests, use the `run_tests.py` script:

```bash
python tests/run_tests.py
```

## Creating New Tests

When creating new tests, follow these guidelines:

1. Create a new file with a descriptive name (e.g., `test_feature_name.py`).
2. Use the `unittest` framework for writing tests.
3. Add the test to the `run_tests.py` script.
