# Product Context - Binary Security Analysis Platform

## Why This Project Exists

### The Problem
**Traditional binary analysis is fragmented, time-consuming, and requires deep expertise**

Modern cybersecurity professionals face significant challenges when analyzing binary files:

1. **Tool Fragmentation**: Analysts must use multiple disconnected tools (Ghidra, IDA Pro, custom scripts) with no unified workflow
2. **Steep Learning Curve**: Ghidra's powerful capabilities require extensive training and expertise to use effectively
3. **Manual Process**: Most analysis requires repetitive manual steps with no automation or AI assistance
4. **Limited Collaboration**: Analysis results are difficult to share and document for team collaboration
5. **Inconsistent Results**: Manual analysis leads to inconsistent findings and potential oversight of critical vulnerabilities
6. **Time Intensive**: Complete binary analysis can take days or weeks for complex binaries
