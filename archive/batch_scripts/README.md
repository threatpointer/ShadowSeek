# Batch Scripts Archive

This directory contains batch scripts that were used during development but are not required for the core functionality of the application.

## Files

- **start_bridge.bat**: Script to start the Ghidra Bridge server.
- **start_ghidra_bridge.bat**: Another script to start the Ghidra Bridge server.
- **restart.bat**: Script to restart the application.
- **start.bat**: Original script to start the application (replaced by start_all.bat).

## Usage

These scripts are kept for reference but are not actively used in the application. The core functionality has been integrated into the main application code.

For starting the application, use the main `start_all.bat` script in the root directory instead.
