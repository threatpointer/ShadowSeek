# Testing Code Archive Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the testing code that has been archived as part of the cleanup process. These files were used during the development and testing of the Ghidra Bridge integration but are no longer needed for production use.

## Archived Files

The following files have been moved to the `archive/testing` directory:

- `test_bridge.py`: Script to test the Ghidra Bridge connection.
- `test_analyze.py`: Script to test the analysis of a binary file.
- `check_tasks.py`: Script to check the status of analysis tasks in the database.
- `test_api.bat`: Batch file to test the API endpoints.
- `update_binary_status.py`: Script to update the status of a binary in the database.
- `test_ghidra_bridge.py`: Script to test the Ghidra Bridge functionality.
- `tests/test_bridge.py` → `tests_test_bridge.py`: Original test file from the tests directory.
- `tests/test_flask_bridge.py` → `tests_test_flask_bridge.py`: Original test file from the tests directory.

## Reason for Archiving

These files were used for testing and debugging during the development of the Ghidra Bridge integration. Now that the integration is working correctly, these files are no longer needed for day-to-day operation of the application.

By archiving them instead of deleting them, we preserve the knowledge and techniques used during development, which may be useful for future reference or if similar issues arise.

## Current Testing Approach

The `tests` directory has been updated with a README explaining that the test files have been moved. The `run_tests.py` script has been updated to reflect this change.

For testing the Ghidra Bridge integration, the `direct_analysis.py` script in the main directory can be used instead of the archived test scripts.
