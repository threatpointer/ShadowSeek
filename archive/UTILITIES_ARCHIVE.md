# Utilities Archive Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the utility scripts and batch files that have been archived as part of the cleanup process. These files were used during the development of the Ghidra Bridge integration but are not required for the core functionality of the application.

## Archived Utilities

The following utility scripts have been moved to the `archive/utilities` directory:

- **check_db.py**: Script to check the database status.
- **setup_ghidra_bridge.py**: Script to set up Ghidra Bridge.
- **ghidra_bridge_port.py**: Module defining the default Ghidra Bridge port.
- **install_bridge_script.py**: Script to install the Ghidra Bridge script.
- **run_ghidra_analysis.py**: Script to run Ghidra analysis (superseded by direct_analysis.py).

## Archived Batch Scripts

The following batch scripts have been moved to the `archive/batch_scripts` directory:

- **start_bridge.bat**: Script to start the Ghidra Bridge server.
- **start_ghidra_bridge.bat**: Another script to start the Ghidra Bridge server.
- **restart.bat**: Script to restart the application.

## Reason for Archiving

These files were used for development, testing, and debugging during the implementation of the Ghidra Bridge integration. Now that the integration is working correctly and has been integrated into the main application code, these files are no longer needed for day-to-day operation.

By archiving them instead of deleting them, we preserve the knowledge and techniques used during development, which may be useful for future reference or if similar issues arise.

## Current Approach

The core functionality provided by these utilities has been integrated into the main application code:

- The `flask_app/ghidra_bridge_manager.py` module handles the Ghidra Bridge connection.
- The `flask_app/task_manager.py` module manages analysis tasks.
- The `direct_analysis.py` script provides a standalone way to analyze binaries.
- The `start.bat` and `stop.bat` scripts in the root directory handle starting and stopping the application.
