PRE-COMPILED TEST BINARIES
=======================

If you don't have GCC installed, you can use these pre-compiled test binaries:

1. binary_compare_v1.exe - Version 1 of the test program
2. binary_compare_v2.exe - Version 2 of the test program

These binaries were compiled on Windows 10 using MinGW GCC 9.2.0.

HOW TO USE:
-----------
1. Navigate to the Binary Comparison page in the ShadowSeek UI (http://localhost:3000/comparison)
2. Select the "Upload & Compare New Binaries" tab
3. Upload binary_compare_v1.exe as Binary 1
4. Upload binary_compare_v2.exe as Binary 2
5. Select "All Differences" as the comparison type
6. Click "Upload & Compare"

SECURITY NOTE:
-------------
These are simple test executables that print text to the console.
They don't perform any harmful operations or access sensitive data.
The source code is available in binary_compare_v1.c and binary_compare_v2.c.
