# Migration from MCP to Ghidra Bridge

## Overview

This document summarizes the migration of the ShadowSeek application from a custom MCP (Model Context Protocol) architecture to use ghidra-bridge instead. The migration involved updating both backend and frontend code to work with the new architecture.

## Key Changes

### Backend Changes

1. **Ghidra Bridge Integration**
   - Implemented `GhidraBridgeManager` class to manage connections to Ghidra via ghidra-bridge
   - Created scripts to start the Ghidra Bridge server in headless mode
   - Added connection status checking and error handling

2. **API Endpoints**
   - Updated API endpoints to work with the new Ghidra Bridge architecture
   - Added `/api/bridge/test` endpoint for testing the bridge connection
   - Modified `/api/status` endpoint to report bridge connection status

3. **Task Management**
   - Implemented `ThreadingTaskManager` class to replace the previous task queue system
   - Updated task execution to use Ghidra Bridge instead of MCP

### Frontend Changes

1. **System Status**
   - Updated to display Ghidra Bridge connection status
   - Added error handling for API connection issues

2. **File Upload**
   - Modified to work with the new API endpoints
   - Added better error handling for server connection issues

3. **Analysis Components**
   - Updated to work with the new backend architecture

## Setup and Configuration

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Created `.env` file for configuration settings
   - Added Ghidra path configuration

2. **Startup Scripts**
   - Created `start_ghidra_bridge.bat` to start the Ghidra Bridge server
   - Created `start_all.bat` to start all components in the correct order

3. **Testing**
   - Created test scripts to verify the Ghidra Bridge connection
   - Added debugging endpoints for troubleshooting

## Issues and Solutions

1. **Missing Module**
   - Created `ghidra_bridge_port.py` to fix the missing module error in the Ghidra Bridge server script

2. **Connection Parameters**
   - Fixed GhidraBridge connection by using the correct parameters (`connect_to_host` and `connect_to_port`)

3. **Database Schema**
   - Updated models to remove unused columns
   - Added script to reset and initialize the database

## Next Steps

1. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Test all analysis features with the new architecture
   - Verify that all components work correctly together

2. **Documentation**
   - Update user documentation to reflect the new architecture
   - Add developer documentation for the Ghidra Bridge integration

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize bridge connection management
   - Add connection pooling for better performance
